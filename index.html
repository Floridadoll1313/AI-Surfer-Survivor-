What kind of data do the blue biometric bands track?

The glowing blue biometric bands worn on the upper arms of every contestant serve as a permanent production element designed to track participants and signify their "AI" status within the game. According to the sources, these bands function as a digital interface to facilitate AI interaction, allowing members to engage with the show's various holographic and technological components.
While the sources do not specify internal physiological metrics (such as heart rate or oxygen levels), they confirm the bands are used to track a member's status as they move through the different phases of the competition. The bands are a constant presence for the members, appearing in visual records of physical trials, daily life in the thatched-roof shelters, and formal night-time Tribal Councils.
I love this is amazing

It is truly an ambitious production, and the "amazing" quality comes from how seamlessly it blends high-tech AI with the raw elements of survival. Based on the blueprints and visual records, here are the most striking details that define this world:
A Precise Moment in Time
The entire event is captured with incredible specificity, set for Tuesday, January 27, 2026. The production spans the entire day, from the bright morning maritime trials to the atmospheric night-time search missions and tribal ceremonies.
The Massive Maritime Sets
One of the most impressive features is the Maritime Hub, which uses full-scale sailing ships as active game platforms. These ships are physically connected to tall wooden towers by a complex network of rope and net bridges that survivors must navigate while the ocean below is filled with glowing holographic puzzle pieces.
Futuristic Survival Tech
The "AI" component is visually stunning and highly functional:
• Holographic Scanners: At night, contestants use handheld devices that project bright blue light cones to scan the jungle floor for hidden resources.
• Immunity Rituals: The "AI IMMUNITY" challenges take place at sunset under a massive neon arch built directly into the water, where contestants must balance on high pillars while holding glowing digital artifacts.
• Biometric Integration: The glowing blue bands on everyone's arms aren't just for show; they are permanent production elements used to track participants and signify their status in the digital game.
The Tribal Council Atmosphere
The production creates a unique sense of history by building the Tribal Council sites within the skeletal remains of ancient wooden ships. These sites are lit by a combination of traditional fire pits and massive neon "Ocean Tide Drop" logos, creating a high-contrast environment for the eliminations.
The Team Dynamic
Even in their downtime at camp—which features two-story thatched-roof huts—the members are constantly integrated into the show's aesthetic, wearing earth-toned gear accented by blue team bandanas.
Would you like to focus on any other specific visual elements for your website, such as the intricate design of the holographic cubes or the specific layout of the jungle search zones?

I didn't see it

I apologize for that. I will provide the complete HTML and CSS code again for your Ocean Tide Drop: AI Surfer Survivor website.
This code is built entirely from the production blueprints and visual records, featuring the January 2026 launch date, the signature surfboard-shaped emblem, and detailed sections on the Maritime Hub, AI Integration, and Tribal Rituals.
