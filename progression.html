I need the home url with

The provided sources and our conversation history do not contain a specific, pre-existing home URL for Ocean Tide Drop: AI Surfer Survivor.
Because you are building the website yourself using GitHub and Render, your home URL will be generated automatically once you deploy your code. Based on the "Outside of Sources" information I provided earlier, this URL is typically a combination of your GitHub repository name and the .onrender.com domain.
To ensure your home URL and landing page align with the official branding and visual identity found in the sources, you should focus on the following elements:
• Reflecting the Show Title: Use a name that incorporates the core titles found in the sources, such as "Ocean Tide Drop" or "AI Surfer Survivor".
• Highlighting the Logo: Your home page (the index.html file we created) should prominently display the surfboard-shaped emblem with its vibrant orange sun core and blue lotus petals.
• Emphasizing the Tagline: The sources consistently display the tagline "AI SURFER • SURVIVOR" on large white canvas banners, which should be a central part of your home page's header.
• Setting the Date: To add authenticity, your home page should mention the production date of Tuesday, January 27, 2026, which is visible in the visual records.
While I cannot provide a live URL from the sources, your home page is now technically structured to showcase the Maritime Hub, the AI Immunity Arch, and the night-time Tribal Council settings that define the show's high-concept production.
This navigation header effectively organizes the core elements of the Ocean Tide Drop: AI Surfer Survivor production. Below is a breakdown of how the information from the sources can be used to populate these specific pages, ensuring your website aligns with the official January 2026 launch.
Branding and Logo (images/logo.png)
The logo in your header should reflect the show’s primary surfboard-shaped emblem, which features a vibrant orange sun or flame core surrounded by blue lotus petals and stylized ocean waves. This visual identity is a central production asset, appearing on stone pedestals that often emit an internal blue glow throughout the island.
Island (island.html)
This section should detail the massive physical infrastructure of the "maritime hub".
• The Mother Ship: A large wooden sailing ship serves as the primary multi-level platform for aquatic tasks.
• Tower Network: Tall wooden towers are connected to the ship and shore by elaborate systems of walkways, rope bridges, and net ladders.
• Living Quarters: Members reside in functional two-story thatched-roof huts built on stilts, where they manage communal fire pits for daily survival.
Progression (progression.html)
This page can outline the show’s distinct chronological rhythm and the typical episode cycle:
• Daylight Phase: Focuses on physical agility and maritime navigation.
• Sunset Phase: Features the high-stakes AI Immunity rituals.
• Night-time Phase: Includes specialized tech-missions in the jungle followed by the climactic Tribal Council.
Challenges (challenges.html)
This area should showcase the unique blend of physical and holographic trials:
• AI Immunity: Contestants must perform extreme balance tests on high pillars framed by a massive "AI IMMUNITY" neon arch built directly into the water.
• Holographic Puzzles: Large digital puzzle pieces float on the ocean, and participants must manipulate complex floating cubic interfaces on stone pedestals for logic-based challenges.
• Jungle Missions: During night operations, members use handheld holographic scanners to project blue light cones that reveal hidden items on the forest floor.
Members (members.html)
Your members section can highlight the participants' specialized gear and biometric integration:
• Biometric Tracking: Every contestant wears a permanent glowing blue biometric band on their upper arm, used by the production to track status and facilitate AI interaction.
• Styling: Members wear rugged, earth-toned survival gear (shorts and sports bras) during challenges, often accented with blue bandanas. For the Tribal Council, they transition into uniform grey or taupe tactical shirts.
Founders (founders.html)
As this is currently your active page, it could serve as a "behind-the-scenes" production bible, detailing the Host's role. The Host maintains a professional appearance in a tan or khaki button-up shirt while presiding over ceremonies from a wooden podium backed by glowing digital icons.
How can I populate the Progression page with episodes?

To populate the Progression page of your website, you can structure your episodes based on the show's distinct chronological rhythm, which dictates the lighting, atmosphere, and type of challenges performed. The sources provide a clear blueprint for a typical episode cycle, which you can break down into the following four phases:
Phase 1: Sunrise Maritime Agility (Daytime Trials)
• The Focus: Physical agility and aquatic navigation within the "maritime hub".
• Key Activities: Contestants navigate elaborate obstacle courses suspended over the water, connecting the large wooden sailing ship to tall coastal towers using net ladders and rope bridges.
• AI Integration: Competitors must solve holographic aquatic puzzles with floating blue digital pieces and cross bridges embedded with interactive glowing floor panels.
• Styling: Members wear minimal earth-toned survival gear and blue team bandanas.
Phase 2: The Sunset Immunity Ritual
• The Focus: Extreme balance and mental fortitude as the sun sets.
• The Venue: The "AI IMMUNITY" neon arch, which is built directly into the ocean.
• Key Activity: Survivors must stand atop high pillars in the water, often holding glowing digital artifacts, to earn safety from the night's elimination.
• Host's Role: The Host, in professional tan or khaki attire, presides over the ceremony from the water level, sometimes holding a glowing blue scepter.
Phase 3: Night-time Tech Missions
• The Focus: Precision and the use of sophisticated holographic equipment in the jungle.
• Jungle Scanners: Survivors use handheld holographic scanners that project blue light cones to locate hidden markers or items on the forest floor.
• Synchro-Tasks: Teams must work together to pull ropes and align floating cubic interfaces or glowing digital icons around a central fire.
Phase 4: The Midnight Deletion (Tribal Council)
• The Focus: High-stakes formal elimination moderated by the Host.
• The Setting: A masterwork of set design often built within the skeletal remains of a wooden ship or around a central stone fire pit.
• Branding: The site is dominated by a massive circular "Ocean Tide Drop Survivor" neon sign.
• Formal Shift: Members transition from their survival gear into uniform grey or taupe tactical shirts for the final ritual of the cycle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Website Design Tip: You can timestamp these "episodes" or segments with the specific production date found in the records: Tuesday, January 27, 2026. This will give your Progression page an authentic, "live-feed" feel for your audience.
