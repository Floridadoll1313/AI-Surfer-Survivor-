          Before the Realm had a name, before the islands rose, before the
          ceremonies were written — there was a wanderer walking the edge of the
          world with three loyal anchors at her side.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dawn Tides whispered first to her. They showed her the shape of
          what could be. And she answered.
        </p>
