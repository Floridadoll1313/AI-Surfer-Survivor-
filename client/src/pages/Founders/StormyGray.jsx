        Stormy Gray is my shield — loyal, alert, and fiercely loving. She has
        walked beside me through every dark night, every long stretch of road,
        every moment where I didn’t know what tomorrow would bring.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        People misunderstand her sometimes. They see her intensity and think
        she’s an “attack dog.” But Stormy isn’t violent — she’s vigilant. She’s
        a survivor, just like me.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        When we were abandoned at that gas station… when we slept in the
        woods… when we walked for hours with nothing but hope and a cart…
        Stormy stayed close, watching every sound, every shadow, every
        stranger.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        She is courage wrapped in fur. She is loyalty in motion. She is the
        heartbeat that kept me going when I had nothing left.

        Stormy Gray is the protector of our story.
