      <h1 className="founder-title">Sailor Ann — The Gentle Heart</h1>

      <p className="founder-text">
        Sailor Ann is the quiet soul of our family — steady, soft, and full of
        wisdom earned from miles on the road. She doesn’t rush. She doesn’t
        push. She simply walks at her own pace, and we follow her lead.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        When life forced us into the woods, into parking lots, into long days of
        walking with everything we owned in a cart, Sailor Ann reminded me to
        breathe. She’d look back at me with those soft eyes, as if to say,
        “We’ll get there. One step at a time.”
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        She’s older now, and her body moves slower, but her spirit is strong.
        Every mile we walked together built her into the quiet anchor of our
        pack.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        Sailor Ann is proof that gentleness is its own kind of strength.
