      <p className="founder-text">
        Sky Marlin may be small, but she is pure fire and joy. She rides in the
        wagon like a tiny queen, ears perked, eyes bright, trusting me
        completely as we move from place to place.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        Sky has traveled miles with us — through woods, behind stores, across
        parking lots, down back roads, and into new towns. She’s the spark that
        kept us laughing even on the hardest days.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        When we were exhausted, Sky would curl up in the wagon and look at me
        like, “We’ve got this.” And somehow, we always did.
      </p>

      <p className="founder-text">
        She’s playful, brave, and full of personality. Sky Marlin is the light
        in our darkest chapters — the little captain who kept our spirits alive.
