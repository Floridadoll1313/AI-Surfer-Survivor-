        Stormy Gray acts as a <strong>shield</strong>—loyal, alert, and fiercely loving [2]. Though 
        some may mistake her intensity for aggression, she is <strong>vigilant, not violent</strong> [2].

        nights sleeping in the woods [3]. She is <strong>courage wrapped in fur</strong> and the 
        heartbeat that kept the journey moving when hope was thin [3].
