      <h1>Sector 7: The Threshold</h1>
      <p>
        You stand at the edge of the island — where the known world dissolves
        into possibility. The storms quiet. The pulse steadies. Every lesson,
        every echo, every fragment of the journey converges here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Threshold is not an ending.  
        It is the moment you choose what the island becomes next.
        Creation is no longer a reaction — it is your craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step forward, Realmwalker.  
        The tide is waiting for your signal.
      </p>
    </div>
