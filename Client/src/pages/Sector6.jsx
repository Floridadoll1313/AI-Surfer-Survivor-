      <h1>Sector 6: The Forge of Echoes</h1>
      <p>
        Deep within the island’s core lies the Forge — a chamber where sound,
        memory, and intention collide. Every action you’ve taken reverberates
        here, shaping the tools you’ll carry into the final sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where creation becomes consequence.  
        Patterns you’ve learned return as echoes, sharpening your instincts and
        revealing the deeper architecture of Ocean Tide Drop.
      </p>
